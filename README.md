# **Customer Service Complaint Analysis**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing customer service complaint emails to extract issues and classify them into distinct topics using topic modeling techniques. The project is implemented in two main stages:
1. Extracting key issues from raw email data using AWS Bedrock and Llama3 model.
2. Performing semantic grouping and topic modeling using PyLDA and visualizing the results.

## **Project Workflow**

### **Stage 1: Extracting Issues from Emails**
- **Objective:** Extract main issues from raw customer service emails.
- **Steps:**
  1. Used the AWS Bedrock service with the Llama3 model to process email text.
  2. Extracted the primary issue in 2-3 words using a customized prompt.
  3. Truncated lengthy emails to improve efficiency and accuracy.
  4. Saved the extracted issues in a CSV file (`customer_service_email_issues1_dataset.csv`).

- **Key Libraries/Tools:** 
  - `boto3` (AWS Bedrock API)
  - Python JSON and pandas libraries

### **Stage 2: Semantic Grouping and Topic Modeling**
- **Objective:** Clean the issues and classify them into topics using topic modeling.
- **Steps:**
  1. Cleaned the issues by:
     - Removing special characters and non-alphanumeric text.
     - Lowercasing the text and removing stopwords.
     - Filtering out non-meaningful issues with fewer than 2 words.
  2. Merged semantically similar issues into standard forms.
  3. Applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using `gensim` to classify issues into topics.
  4. Visualized the topics using `pyLDAvis`.

- **Key Libraries/Tools:**
  - `gensim` for topic modeling
  - `nltk` for text preprocessing
  - `pyLDAvis` for visualization

## **Setup Instructions**
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/srinidhigadipelly/customer-complaints-topic-modeling.git
   cd customer-complaint-topic-modeling

2. **Install Dependencies**
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the required libraries:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the Scripts** 
Step 1: Extract Issues
Execute the extract_issues.py script:
python extract_issues.py
This will generate a CSV file containing the extracted issues.

Step 2: Perform Topic Modeling
Run the topic_modeling.py script:
python topic_modeling.py

This will classify the issues into topics and display a visualization using PyLDAVis. 

How It Works
1. Extract Issues:
- Emails are truncated to a manageable size (512 characters).
- The Llama3 model is prompted to extract concise issues.
- Issues are validated and saved in a CSV file.

2. Semantic Grouping and Topic Modeling:
- Cleaned and standardized the issues.
- Applied LDA to classify issues into topics.
- Visualized the topics to identify key themes.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the project:
> boto3
> json
> pandas
> gensim
> nltk
> pyLDAvis
These can be installed using the requirements.txt file:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Visualization
The pyLDAvis tool provides an interactive visualization of the topics generated by the LDA model, allowing for deeper insights into customer complaint trends.

## Project Purpose
This project demonstrates a real-world application of:
> NLP for extracting meaningful insights from unstructured text data.
> Topic Modeling for categorizing complaints into actionable themes.
> Visualization for exploring topics interactively.
